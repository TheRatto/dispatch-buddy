# Appendix B: International NOTAM (Q) Codes

This appendix is used to interpret the contents of coded international NOTAMs.

A NOTAM code group contains five letters:

- **First Letter**: Always the letter “Q” to indicate a code abbreviation for use in the composition of NOTAMs.
- **Second and Third Letters**: Identify the subject being reported.
- **Fourth and Fifth Letters**: Identify the status of operation of the subject being reported.
