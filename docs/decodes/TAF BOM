# BOM TAF Decode Guide

This document provides reference information for decoding TAF and TAF3 messages according to the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM).

---

## 1. Overview
A **TAF** (Terminal Aerodrome Forecast) is a coded weather forecast for within 5 nautical miles of an aerodrome; **TAF3** is similar but issued every 3 hours :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

---

## 2. Common Forecast Elements

- **FMhhmm**: Forecast from time (UTC); begins a new line
- **TEMPO**: Temporary fluctuations (< 1 hr, covering less than half the period)
- **BECMG hhmm/hhmm**: Gradual change expected during this timeframe
- **PROB30 / PROB40**: Probability (%) of forecast conditions within period
- **TLhhmm / AT hhmm**: Precise change time or at a specific time

---

## 3. Wind & Visibility

- Format: `dddffKT`
  - `ddd`: direction in degrees
  - `ff`: speed in knots

- Visibility in statute miles or meters (e.g., `6SM`, `9999`)
- RVR notation: `R28L/2600FT`

---

## 4. Weather Phenomena & Clouds

- Intensity: `-` = light, no symbol = moderate, `+` = heavy
- Descriptors: `MI`, `BC`, `SH`, `TS`, etc.
- Phenomena: `RA`, `DZ`, `SN`, `FG`, `HZ`, `TSRA`, etc.
- Cloud types: `FEW`, `SCT`, `BKN`, `OVC`, with heights (in hundreds of feet)
- Vertical visibility: `VV004` (400 ft)

## 5. Example Format

TAF YMML 151100Z 1512/1618 20008KT CAVOK
FM151600 18010KT SCT020
TEMPO 1518/1522 5000 RA BKN010
BECMG 1606/1608 24012KT


---

## 6. Tips for Dispatch Buddy

- Split forecast blocks by `FM`, `TEMPO`, `BECMG`, or line break
- Decode each to English:
  - `FM151600`: “From 16:00 UTC, wind 180°/10 kt, scattered clouds at 2,000 ft”
  - `TEMPO ...`: “Temporary rain lowering visibility”
- Include PROB and TL/AT conditions in risk scoring
