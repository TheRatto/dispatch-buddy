- [x] Extract TAF tab UI into standalone widgets (`TafTab`, `TafCompactDetails`, `TafPeriodCard`, `GridItemWithConcurrent`)
  - Resolved TimePeriod class conflicts successfully
  - App builds and runs without errors

## In Progress / Next
- [ ] Extract TAFs2 tab UI (timeline-based TAF display with slider)
- [ ] Continue extracting remaining large UI components from `raw_data_screen.dart`

**Extraction pattern:**
- Preserve all logic and state.
- Review for hidden dependencies before each extraction.
- Update documentation after each major step.
- Handle class conflicts by using existing classes when possible.
