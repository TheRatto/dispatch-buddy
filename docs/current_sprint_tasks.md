# Current Sprint Tasks - Hybrid Implementation

## ✅ Completed Tasks
### Task 24: Hybrid NAIPS+API Weather Merge ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Populate mixed briefings with NAIPS for AU/covered ICAOs and API for international.

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ `ApiService`: Merge NAIPS METARs with API METARs, dedupe by issue time; TAFs prefer NAIPS, fallback to API.
- ✅ `NAIPSParser`: Require explicit `METAR`/`SPECI` prefix; preserve label; allow optional space before `Z` in TAF header.
- ✅ `FlightProvider`: Latest-per-ICAO selection to prevent duplicate METAR/TAF cards.

**Results:**
- ✅ YPPH/YSSY/WSSS show single latest METAR.
- ✅ EGLL/CYYZ show TAFs via API fallback; METARs decode with correct issue time.

### Task 25: Dynamic Age & ATIS Fixes ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Ensure METAR/ATIS ages reflect issue time and update every minute.

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ `MetarTab`: Timer-based rebuild; header `HHMMZ` formatting; age based on parsed issue time.
- ✅ `AtisCard`: Age computed from ATIS header issue time; timer for dynamic updates; regex robust to spacing.

**Results:**
- ✅ Age badges align with TAF dynamic behavior; UTC as default.

### Task 26: Decode Parity – SKC Support ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Show “Sky Clear” when `SKC` present (international formats).

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ `WeatherParser`: Added `SKC` handling alongside NSC/NCD.

**Results:**
- ✅ EGLL/CYYZ TAFs show “Sky Clear” when applicable.

### Task 21: Add Home Button to Bottom Navigation ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Add Home button to bottom navigation bar for consistent navigation

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/screens/briefing_tabs_screen.dart`

**Changes Made:**

- **Index 1**: Summary 📊 (was index 0)
- **Index 2**: Airports ✈️ (was index 1)
- **Index 3**: Raw Data `<>` (was index 2)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Consistent navigation across all screens
- ✅ Easy access to Home from any briefing tab

- **"Start New Briefing"** button that navigates to `/input`

#### **Airport Details Screen Empty State:**
- ✈️ **Airport Details** icon and title
- "No airports selected" subtitle
- Helpful description: "Add airports to your flight plan to view runway information, navaids, and system status."

### Task 23: Fix Pull-to-Refresh Persistence Issue ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Ensure pull-to-refresh data persists when navigating away and back

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- ❌ **Pull-to-refresh** used `refreshFlightData()` which only updated data in memory
- ❌ **Refresh buttons** used `BriefingRefreshService.refreshBriefing()` which saved to storage
- ❌ **Inconsistent behavior** between the two refresh methods
- ❌ **Data loss** when navigating away and back

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ **Unified refresh method** `refreshCurrentData()` in FlightProvider
- ✅ **Smart routing**: Uses `BriefingRefreshService.refreshBriefing()` for both current and previous briefings
- ✅ **Consistent behavior**: Both pull-to-refresh and refresh buttons now work identically
- ✅ **Proper persistence**: Creates versioned backups and updates home screen timestamps

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/providers/flight_provider.dart` - Added `refreshCurrentData()` method
- `lib/screens/decoded_screen.dart` - **REMOVED** (deprecated TAF implementation)
- `lib/screens/alternate_data_screen.dart` - Updated RefreshIndicator callbacks
- `lib/screens/summary_screen.dart` - Updated RefreshIndicator callbacks
- `lib/screens/airport_detail_screen.dart` - Updated RefreshIndicator callbacks
- `lib/screens/raw_data_screen.dart` - Updated RefreshIndicator callbacks

**Technical Implementation:**
```dart
/// Unified refresh method that handles both current and previous briefings
Future<void> refreshCurrentData({
  bool? naipsEnabled,
  String? naipsUsername,
  String? naipsPassword,
}) async {
  if (_currentBriefing != null) {
    // For previous briefings, use the briefing refresh method
    await refreshBriefingByIdUnified(_currentBriefing!.id);
  } else {
    // For current briefings, refresh flight data and save to storage
    await refreshFlightData(
      naipsEnabled: naipsEnabled,
      naipsUsername: naipsUsername,
      naipsPassword: naipsPassword,
    );
    
    // Convert the refreshed flight to a briefing and save it
    if (_currentFlight != null) {
      final briefing = Briefing(/* ... */);
      await BriefingStorageService.saveBriefing(briefing);
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Consistent UX** - Both refresh methods work identically
