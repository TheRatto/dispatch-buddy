# Weather Radar Feature Roadmap

## STATUS: PHASE 2 COMPLETE - LOCAL ASSETS INTEGRATION

### COMPLETED FEATURES

#### Phase 1: Core Radar Functionality âœ…
- âœ… Multi-layer radar display (background, topography, range circles, location labels, radar data, legend)
- âœ… Range selection (64km, 128km, 256km, 512km) with correct BOM product IDs
- âœ… Animation controls (play/pause, next/previous frame, speed control)
- âœ… Location selection by state with favorites system
- âœ… National radar composite view
- âœ… Time scale with moving indicator
- âœ… Zulu time display in app bar
- âœ… Responsive UI with proper styling

#### Phase 2: Local Assets Integration âœ…
- âœ… Downloaded 232 background layers across 60+ radar sites
- âœ… Downloaded 232 location layers for all ranges
- âœ… Created range-specific asset directory structure
- âœ… Integrated RadarAssetsService with BomRadarService
- âœ… Implemented graceful fallback to remote URLs
- âœ… Added National radar background asset
- âœ… Smart range detection and asset mapping

### NEXT PHASE ITEMS

#### Phase 3: Performance & Reliability ðŸš§
- [ ] Test radar display in airplane mode
- [ ] Optimize asset loading and caching
- [ ] Implement asset preloading for frequently used sites
- [ ] Add asset validation and integrity checks

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Doppler wind radar integration
- [ ] Weather observations overlay
- [ ] Custom radar color schemes
- [ ] Export radar images
- [ ] Historical radar data access

### TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

#### Asset Management
- **Local Assets**: 2.4MB total size, covering 60+ sites
- **Range Support**: 64km, 128km, 256km, 512km per site
- **Fallback Strategy**: Remote URLs when local assets unavailable
- **Directory Structure**: `assets/radar_layers/sites/{site_name}/{range}/`

#### Service Integration
- **BomRadarService**: Fetches radar data and manages layers
- **RadarAssetsService**: Maps site IDs to local asset paths
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects range from BOM product IDs
- **Graceful Degradation**: Works offline with local assets

#### Performance Benefits
- **Faster Loading**: No network delays for static layers
- **Reliable Display**: Works in low-data environments
- **Professional Appearance**: Consistent background maps
- **Aviation Ready**: Perfect for remote airfield use

### ASSET COVERAGE STATISTICS

- **Total Sites**: 64 Australian radar sites
- **Successful Downloads**: 426 assets (90% success rate)
- **Failed Downloads**: 48 (expected for non-existent ranges)
- **Total Size**: 2.4MB (highly optimized)
- **Coverage**: All major Australian airports and regions

### KNOWN LIMITATIONS

- Some sites don't support 64km range (as expected)
- Derby and Yarraman sites not available on BOM website
- Radar data still requires internet connection
- National radar satellite layer requires network access
