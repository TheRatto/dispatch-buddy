# Weather Radar Feature Roadmap

## STATUS: PHASE 3 COMPLETE - FULL FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION

### COMPLETED FEATURES

#### Phase 1: Core Radar Functionality âœ…
- âœ… Multi-layer radar display (background, topography, range circles, location labels, radar data, legend)
- âœ… Range selection (64km, 128km, 256km, 512km) with correct BOM product IDs
- âœ… Animation controls (play/pause, next/previous frame, speed control)
- âœ… Location selection by state with favorites system
- âœ… National radar composite view
- âœ… Time scale with moving indicator
- âœ… Zulu time display in app bar
- âœ… Responsive UI with proper styling

#### Phase 2: Local Assets Integration âœ…
- âœ… Downloaded 605+ radar layer assets across 60+ radar sites
- âœ… Created optimized asset directory structure (sites + common)
- âœ… Integrated RadarAssetsService with BomRadarService
- âœ… Implemented graceful fallback to remote URLs
- âœ… Added National radar background and legend assets
- âœ… Smart range detection and asset mapping
- âœ… Range circles and legend now load locally

#### Phase 3: User Experience & Persistence âœ…
- âœ… Favorites persistence using SharedPreferences
- âœ… Default radar location set to National
- âœ… Legend overlay with proper transparency alignment
- âœ… Professional BOM website-style legend positioning
- âœ… Seamless asset loading with 3.9MB total size

### NEXT PHASE ITEMS

#### Phase 4: Performance & Reliability ðŸš§
- [ ] Test radar display in airplane mode
- [ ] Optimize asset loading and caching
- [ ] Implement asset preloading for frequently used sites
- [ ] Add asset validation and integrity checks

#### Phase 5: Advanced Features ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Doppler wind radar integration
- [ ] Weather observations overlay
- [ ] Custom radar color schemes
- [ ] Export radar images
- [ ] Historical radar data access

## OTHER COMPLETED FEATURES

#### Charts Feature âœ… **PHASE 2 SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE**
- âœ… NAIPS graphical charts integration
- âœ… Full chart viewer with pinch-to-zoom
- âœ… Chart categories: MSL, SIGWX, SIGMET, SATPIC, Grid Point Winds
- âœ… Live validity display and countdown timers
- âœ… PDF fallback and chart rotation
- âœ… Professional UI with category icons

### TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

#### Asset Management
- **Local Assets**: 3.9MB total size, covering 60+ sites
- **Range Support**: 64km, 128km, 256km, 512km per site
- **Fallback Strategy**: Remote URLs when local assets unavailable
- **Directory Structure**: `assets/radar_layers/sites/{site_name}/{range}/` + `assets/radar_layers/common/`

#### Service Integration
- **BomRadarService**: Fetches radar data and manages layers
- **RadarAssetsService**: Maps site IDs to local asset paths
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects range from BOM product IDs
- **Graceful Degradation**: Works offline with local assets

#### Performance Benefits
- **Faster Loading**: No network delays for static layers
- **Reliable Display**: Works in low-data environments
- **Professional Appearance**: Consistent background maps
- **Aviation Ready**: Perfect for remote airfield use

### ASSET COVERAGE STATISTICS

- **Total Sites**: 64 Australian radar sites
- **Total Assets**: 605+ PNG files (backgrounds, ranges, legend, locations)
- **Total Size**: 3.9MB (highly optimized)
- **Coverage**: All major Australian airports and regions
- **Local Loading**: Range circles, legend, and backgrounds load instantly

### KNOWN LIMITATIONS

- Some sites don't support 64km range (as expected)
- Derby and Yarraman sites not available on BOM website
- Radar data still requires internet connection
- National radar satellite layer requires network access

### RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS

- âœ… **Favorites Persistence**: User favorites now save across app sessions
- âœ… **Default to National**: App opens to continental view by default
- âœ… **Legend Overlay**: Professional BOM-style legend positioning
- âœ… **Asset Optimization**: 605+ assets in 3.9MB with instant loading
- âœ… **Complete Integration**: All static layers load locally with remote fallback
