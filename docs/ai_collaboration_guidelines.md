# AI Collaboration Guidelines for Briefing Buddy

## üéØ How to Work Effectively with AI in Cursor

### **Before Starting an AI Session**

1. **Update Your Daily Log** - Make sure your development log is current
2. **Have Clear Context** - Know what file you're working in and what you want to achieve
3. **Prepare Specific Questions** - Don't ask "help me" - ask "help me implement X in Y way"
4. **Gather Relevant Code** - Have the code you want to discuss ready to paste

---

## üìã **AI Session Template**

### **Start Every AI Session With:**

```
I'm working on: [File/Feature Name]
Current sprint goal: [What you're trying to achieve this week]
Today's priority: [What you want to accomplish in this session]
Time available: [How much time you have to work on this]
```

### **When Asking for Help:**

```
I need help with: [Specific problem or question]
Current code state: [Brief description of what you have]
Here's my current code: [Paste relevant code]
I want to achieve: [Desired outcome]
I'm stuck because: [What's not working or what you don't understand]
```

## üîÑ **Daily AI Workflow**

### **Morning Session (9:00 AM)**
```
"Good morning! I'm starting my development day. Here's what I'm working on today:
- Primary goal: [Goal]
- Current file: [File name]
- Yesterday's progress: [Brief summary]
- Today's first task: [Specific task]

Can you help me plan the best approach for [specific task]?"
```

### **Mid-Session Check-in**
```
"I've been working on [feature] for [X] hours. Here's my progress:
- What I've implemented: [Summary]
- Current challenge: [Specific problem]
- Code to review: [Paste code]

Can you help me [specific question]?"
```

### **End-of-Day Review**
```
"I'm wrapping up my development day. Here's what I accomplished:
- Completed: [List of tasks]
- Learned: [New concepts]
- Blocked by: [Issues]

Can you help me plan tomorrow's priorities and review my approach?"
```

---

## üí° **Effective AI Requests**

### **‚úÖ Good Examples:**

```
"I'm implementing NOTAM grouping in lib/services/notam_grouping_service.dart. 
I want to group by facility type (runway, taxiway, etc.) but my grouping logic 
isn't working correctly. Here's my current code: [code]. 
Can you help me fix the grouping algorithm and explain why my approach isn't working?"
```

```
"I'm working on the TAF parsing feature and need to handle BECMG groups. 
I have the basic parser working but BECMG logic is complex. 
Here's my current implementation: [code]. 
Can you show me the Flutter best practice for handling this type of conditional parsing?"
```

### **‚ùå Avoid These:**

- "This isn't working, fix it"
- "Help me with Flutter" (too vague)
- "What's wrong with my code?" (without showing the code)
- "Make it better" (without specifying what "better" means)

---

## üß† **AI Session Best Practices**

### **1. One Problem at a Time**
- Focus on one specific issue per session
- Don't jump between multiple unrelated problems
- Build on previous solutions before moving to new problems

### **2. Show Your Work**
- Paste the relevant code you're working with
- Explain what you've tried so far
- Share any error messages or unexpected behavior

### **3. Ask for Explanations**
- Don't just ask for solutions
- Ask "Why does this approach work better?"
- Request examples of best practices
- Ask for code review and suggestions

### **4. Iterate and Improve**
- Start with a working solution
- Ask "How can I make this more robust?"
- Request performance improvements
- Ask for testing strategies

---

## üìö **Learning-Focused Questions**

### **Instead of "Fix this":**
```
"Can you explain why my current approach isn't working?"
"What's the Flutter best practice for this pattern?"
"How would a senior developer approach this problem?"
"Can you show me the difference between my approach and the recommended way?"
```

### **Instead of "Make it work":**
```
"Can you walk me through the logic step by step?"
"What are the edge cases I should consider?"
"How can I test this functionality?"
"What could go wrong with this approach?"
```

---

## üîß **Code Review Requests**

### **When Asking for Code Review:**
```
"Can you review this code for:
- Best practices
- Performance improvements
- Error handling
- Testing coverage
- Code organization

Here's my code: [paste code]"
```

### **When Asking for Refactoring:**
```
"I want to refactor this code to be:
- More maintainable
- More testable
- More performant
- More readable

Current code: [paste code]
What's your recommended approach?"
```

---

## üìù **Documentation Requests**

### **When Asking for Documentation Help:**
```
"I need to document this feature for:
- Other developers
- Future maintenance
- API users
- Testing purposes

Can you help me create:
- Code comments
- README updates
- API documentation
- Usage examples"
```

---

## üöÄ **Advanced AI Collaboration**

### **Feature Planning Sessions:**
```
"I'm planning to implement [feature]. Here's my current approach:
- Architecture: [Description]
- Data flow: [Description]
- UI components: [Description]

Can you help me:
- Identify potential issues?
- Suggest better approaches?
- Plan the implementation steps?
- Estimate complexity?"
```

### **Debugging Sessions:**
```
"I'm debugging [issue]. Here's what I know:
- Expected behavior: [Description]
- Actual behavior: [Description]
- Error messages: [Paste errors]
- Steps to reproduce: [List steps]

Can you help me:
- Identify the root cause?
- Suggest debugging strategies?
- Review my debugging approach?"
```

---

## üìä **Session Tracking**

### **After Each AI Session, Update Your Log:**
- [ ] What problem did I solve?
- [ ] What did I learn?
- [ ] What should I do next?
- [ ] What questions do I have for next session?

---

## üéØ **Remember: AI is Your Pair Programming Partner**

- **Be specific** about what you need
- **Show your work** so I can understand your context
- **Ask for explanations** not just solutions
- **Iterate and improve** based on feedback
- **Keep learning** from each interaction

*The better you communicate your context and goals, the more effectively I can help you become a better developer!*
