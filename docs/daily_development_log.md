## Today's Date: 2025-01-25
## Current Sprint: UI/UX Polish and ATIS Formatting Improvements

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Today's Work (January 25, 2025)

### Major Accomplishments
- âœ… **Font Size Consistency**: Unified all weather cards (TAF, ATIS, METAR) to use consistent font sizes
  - Age indicators: 14px across all cards
  - Content text: 14px across all cards  
  - Decoded METAR labels: 12px, values: 14px (matching TAF decoded card)
- âœ… **Card Layout Alignment**: Fixed ATIS/METAR cards to match TAF card width and spacing
  - Removed extra vertical padding from METAR tab
  - Unified bottom spacing to 8px across all tabs
  - Removed unnecessary horizontal divider between ATIS and METAR cards
- âœ… **Header Consistency**: Fixed ATIS/METAR header format consistency
  - Removed ATIS letter from header (e.g., "YSCB ATIS I" â†’ "YSCB ATIS")
  - Unified header format across all weather types
- âœ… **ATIS Formatting Overhaul**: Implemented NAIPs-compliant ATIS formatting
  - Added natural line break after validity time (no blank line)
  - Implemented consistent 2-space indentation for all body content
  - Created smart line connection algorithm to reduce fragmented sentences
  - Removed unnecessary blank lines and inconsistent indentation

### Technical Implementation Details
- **ATIS Formatter**: Two-stage processing with `_formatAtisText()` and `_connectFragmentedLines()`
- **Smart Connection Rules**: Connects lines ending with continuation words (`AND`, `IN`, `ON`, etc.)
- **Category Preservation**: Maintains separation for weather categories (`RWY:`, `WIND:`, `CLD:`, etc.)
- **Font Hierarchy**: Established consistent typography across all weather displays

### Key Lessons Learned
- Aviation data formatting should follow official standards (NAIPs) for consistency
- Smart text processing can improve readability while maintaining proper structure
- Consistent typography creates professional appearance and better user experience
- Apple design guidelines emphasize whitespace and content grouping over explicit dividers
